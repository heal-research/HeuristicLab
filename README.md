## About HeuristicLab

[HeuristicLab](https://dev.heuristiclab.com) is an open-source environment for heuristic optimization that features several metaheuristic optimization algorithms as well as optimization problems. It is developed by the research group [Heuristic and Evolutionary Algorithms Laboratory (HEAL)](https://heal.heuristiclab.com) of the [University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria](https://www.fh-ooe.at/en) and is based on C# and Microsoft .NET. 

We know that many people are using HeuristicLab in business, research and teaching activities. Please contact us, if you're using HeuristicLab in your teaching activities, if you have interesting business cases, or if you would like to get in contact for a research collaboration. It would be great to hear from you!

## Awards

In May 2009 we submitted HeuristicLab for the **Microsoft Innovation Award 2009**. Both, an expert jury and a public audience, perceived HeuristicLab as one of the three most innovative software projects from 64 submissions. We are of course very happy about such a recognition and the award itself, which was presented by Austria's Federal Minister for Science and Research Dr. Johannes Hahn.

## System Requirements

Starting from 3.3.16 HeuristicLab requires a 64-bit operating system to use all features. Specifically, the OR-Tools integration is affected. You can still run HeuristicLab in 32-bit environments, but you have to remove Google.OrTools.dll from the folder containing the HeuristicLab.exe file before you start it.

HeuristicLab is based on the Microsoft .NET Framework. In order to be able to run HeuristicLab properly, you have to download and install the following software package:
  * [​Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472)
